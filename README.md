# Scroll My Mac

A macOS accessibility app that lets you scroll anywhere by clicking and dragging.

## Vibe code alert

This app was built 100% with [Claude](https://claude.ai), Anthropic's AI assistant, and [GSD](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done). I don't know Swift. I wouldn't have made this app without AI, but it's something I wish existed. Use at your own risk.

## What It Does

Scroll My Mac adds system-wide click-and-drag scrolling to macOS. Toggle scroll mode with a hotkey, then click and drag to scroll any scrollable area on your screen.

- **System-wide scroll mode.** Activated via configurable hotkey (default: F6).
- **Menu bar icon.** Access settings and toggle scroll mode from the menu bar.
- **Natural inertia.** Momentum scrolling with smooth deceleration when you release the drag, like iOS or a trackpad.
- **Click-through detection.** Small movements (~8px) pass through as normal clicks, so you won't accidentally scroll when you meant to click.
- **macOS Accessibility Keyboard aware.** Clicks on the macOS on-screen keyboard always pass through instantly, even while scroll mode is active.
- **Launch at login.** Optional automatic startup.
- **Excluded apps.** Prevent scroll mode from activating in specific apps without disabling scroll mode globally.
- **Free forever.** I made this because I needed it, not to make money.

## Why It Exists

This app was built for users who cannot use a trackpad or scroll wheel due to disability. I rely on an [on-screen keyboard](https://blakewatson.com/journal/writing-and-coding-with-the-macos-accessibility-keyboard/) and mouse for input, and needed a way to [scroll without a scroll wheel](https://blakewatson.com/journal/neglecting-the-scrollbar-a-costly-trend-in-ui-design/) or trackpad gesture.

It was inspired by the [ScrollAnywhere](https://fastaddons.com/#scroll_anywhere) browser extension, which provides click-and-drag scrolling in the browser. Scroll My Mac brings similar (albeit less customizable) capability to operating system level.

## Installation

1. Download `ScrollMyMac.zip` from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/blakewatson/scroll-my-mac/releases/latest)
2. Extract the zip
3. Move `ScrollMyMac.app` to `/Applications`
4. Launch the app and grant Accessibility permission when prompted

## Usage

1. Press **F6** (or your configured hotkey) to toggle scroll mode on
2. Click and drag to scroll (vertically or horizontally)
3. Release to let inertia carry the scroll naturally
4. Small clicks pass through as normal clicks (turn this off in settings if you don’t want this behavior)
5. Press the hotkey again to toggle scroll mode off

> **Tip:** The app includes a safety timeout (enabled by default) that automatically deactivates scroll mode after 10 seconds of no mouse movement. This is helpful when first trying the app -- if your clicks ever stop working as expected, the timeout will restore normal mouse behavior on its own. Once you're comfortable with the app, you can turn the safety timeout off in Settings.

The app window provides settings for hotkey customization and launch at login.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later
- Apple Silicon Macs only (if there is sufficient interest, I can try a universal build)
- Accessibility permission (the app will guide you through granting it on first launch)

## Roadmap

- [x] An optional visual indicator to communicate whether scroll mode is activated.
- [x] Certain interface elements capture the click action before the scroll engine kicks in. Will attempt to fix in a future release.
- [ ] Make inertial scrolling toggleable and add a setting for tuning the coasting speed.
- [ ] Make a hotkey for toggling click-through.
- [ ] Add a setting to change the scroll drag selection (currently mimics macOS' "natural scrolling").

## Support

Check out the [docs](https://scrollmymac.blakewatson.com/docs) for more information about Scroll My Mac's settings and behaviors. If you come across a bug or other issue, I'd appreciate if you could [create an issue](https://github.com/blakewatson/scroll-my-mac/issues).

If you have any questions or need help, send me (Blake) an email at blake@blakewatson.com.

## Share or Donate

The best way to support Scroll My Mac is to share it with your friends and colleagues, especially those who find scrolling difficult. It's hard to get the word out about this sort of thing and there are probably people who would benefit from it but don't know it exists.

If you like Scroll My Mac and want to support its development, consider [buying me a coffee on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/blakewatson).

Most of the code was generated by Claude. That makes the coding a relatively light burden. That said, I do maintain the docs manually and I pay for an Apple Developer account, so any support is appreciated.
