<objective>
Write a comprehensive README.md and publish a GitHub release with the signed, notarized app bundle.

Purpose: Make the app discoverable and downloadable from GitHub so users can understand what it is, why it exists, and get a copy running on their Mac.
Output: README.md in repo root; GitHub release v1.2 with ScrollMyMac.zip attached.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Create README.md in the repo root with the following structure and content:

**Title and tagline:** "Scroll My Mac" — a macOS accessibility app that lets you scroll anywhere by clicking and dragging.

**What it is / What it does section:**
- System-wide click-and-drag scrolling for macOS
- Activated via configurable hotkey (default: F6)
- Natural inertia/momentum when you release the drag
- Works in any scrollable area across the entire OS
- Click-through detection: small movements pass through as normal clicks (~8px threshold)
- Accessibility Keyboard aware: clicks on the on-screen keyboard always pass through

**Why it exists section (personal motivation / accessibility need):**
- Built for users who cannot use a trackpad or scroll wheel due to disability
- Inspired by the "Scroll Anywhere" browser extension, but for the entire OS
- The user relies on an on-screen keyboard and needed a way to scroll without a scroll wheel or trackpad gesture

**How to install section:**
- Download the latest release zip from GitHub Releases
- Extract the zip
- Move ScrollMyMac.app to /Applications
- Launch the app and grant Accessibility permission when prompted
- Note: The app is signed and notarized by Apple, so it opens without Gatekeeper warnings

**How to use section:**
- Press F6 (or your configured hotkey) to toggle scroll mode
- Click and drag to scroll
- Small clicks pass through as normal clicks
- The app window has settings for hotkey customization and launch at login

**Requirements section:**
- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later
- Accessibility permission (the app will guide you through granting it)

**AI-assisted development disclaimer section:**
- This app was built with significant assistance from Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant)
- Include a brief note that AI was used for planning, code generation, and documentation

**License section:**
- Leave a placeholder or note that the user will decide on licensing (do NOT choose a license without user input)

Keep the README concise, clear, and friendly. Use standard GitHub Markdown formatting. Do NOT include badges, CI status, or contribution guidelines -- this is a personal project.
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify README.md exists and contains:
- "Scroll My Mac" in the title
- "accessibility" mentioned in the motivation section
- "AI" or "Claude" mentioned in the disclaimer section
- An install section referencing GitHub Releases
- A usage section mentioning the hotkey
  </verify>
  <done>README.md exists with clear explanations of what the app is, why it exists (accessibility), how to install and use it, and an AI development disclaimer</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Review README and approve before release</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Present the README.md to the user for review. This is a checkpoint — no automated work, just verification of Task 1 output before proceeding to the GitHub release.

What was built: README.md with project documentation covering what the app is, accessibility motivation, install/usage instructions, and AI disclaimer.

How to verify:
1. Read through README.md in the repo root
2. Verify it accurately describes the app
3. Verify the accessibility motivation section reflects your personal experience
4. Verify the AI disclaimer is appropriate
5. Check tone and wording feel right for your project
6. Note any changes you want before the GitHub release is created

Resume signal: Type "approved" to proceed with the GitHub release, or describe changes needed.
  </action>
  <verify>User has approved the README content or requested changes have been applied</verify>
  <done>README.md content approved by user, ready for GitHub release</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Build release zip and publish GitHub release</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Build the release zip.**
Run `./scripts/build-release.sh` from the project root to produce the signed, notarized `build/release/ScrollMyMac.zip`. If the zip already exists from a prior build and the user confirms it is current, skip the build step.

**Step 2: Create a git tag.**
Tag the current commit as `v1.2`:
```
git tag v1.2
git push github v1.2
```

**Step 3: Push latest commits to remote.**
Ensure all commits (including the README) are pushed:
```
git push github main
```

**Step 4: Create the GitHub release.**
Use the `gh` CLI to create a release with the zip attached:
```
gh release create v1.2 build/release/ScrollMyMac.zip \
  --title "Scroll My Mac v1.2" \
  --notes "$(cat <<'NOTES'

1. `cat README.md` — contains app description, accessibility motivation, AI disclaimer
2. `gh release view v1.2` — release exists with zip asset and release notes
3. `git tag -l v1.2` — tag exists
4. Download the zip URL from the release and verify it is a valid zip containing ScrollMyMac.app
